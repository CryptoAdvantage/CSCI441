        <h2 class="fade-transition">How do I do I make money?</h2>
        <p class="fade-transition">
            The first step is to create a trading bot using the Crypto Advantage 
            machine learning process.  Once you're happy with your performance, you 
            only need to tether your bot to the cryptocurrency exchange of your preference.

        <h2 class="fade-transition">What crytocurrency exchanges are supported?</h2>
        <p class="fade-transition">
            The list of supported exchanges continually evolves.  Once you log in, you 
            can view the full list.  Check back regularly because we're adding more daily.

        <h2 class="fade-transition">What cryptocurrencies can be traded?</h2>
        <p class="fade-transition">
            Cyptocurrencies are exchange specific.  Check with your favorite exchange 
            on what's offered, and if we're linked to that exchange, you can trade it.  It's
            as simple as that.
        </p>

        <h2 class="fade-transition">How can I give back?</h2>
        <p class="fade-transition">
            This project is free to you, and we hope you make lots of money from it.  
            To give back to us, we only ask that you tell your friends and family if you like it.
